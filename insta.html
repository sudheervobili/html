				>Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure
				object-oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (like
				int, char, etc) The Java codes are first compiled into byte code
				(machine-independent code).</strong

			Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low-level
			programming functionalities like pointers. Also, Java codes are always
			written in the form of classes and objects.
